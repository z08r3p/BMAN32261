1. About the course 
1.1. Course Aims  
The course aims to give the students an applied understanding of modern entrepreneurial practices and teach them to make informed decisions when running their own businesses. Academic literature will be combined with case studies and practical examples to enhance students’ understanding of entrepreneurship. 
1.2. Learning Outcomes 
By the end of this module   students will: 
·      Develop knowledge of the role of individual and corporate entrepreneurship, types of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial practices, business models, growth strategies, risks, the role of finance. 
·   Collect and critically analyse industry data to identify and pursue viable business opportunities. 
·   Apply a rich toolset of theoretical frameworks to make strategic decisions for their ventures. 
·   Learn how to formulate business ideas and pitch them to potential investors. 
1.3. Employability 
Many students may wish, one day, to found and run their own innovative business or engage in entrepreneurial behavior. in a large corporation. Attendees of this course unit will be better equipped to do so, as participants will be more acutely aware of both the requisite pre-conditions and actions that are most likely to lead to entrepreneuring success. In addition, skills that are part of this unit and that will enhance students’ employability include data analysis, report writing, presenting and working in groups. 
1.4. Social Responsibility 
This course will allow to take a critical perspective on mainstream entrepreneurship. Specifically, we will question many of the mainstream entrepreneurship paradigms like the growth paradigm, profit paradigm, and ‘killing the competition’, and will discuss paradigm-alternative practices like co-creation, coopetition, and social franchising. The cases from the context of sustainability ventures further contribute to an appreciation of ventures aimed at sustainable development implying all three, environmental, social, and economic responsibility. x UN SDGs* (decent work and economic  Environmental Sustainability growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure) x Other (please specify) 
Social sustainability 
1.5. Equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) 
Lectures of this course employ cases from diverse backgrounds around the world. Also, students are encouraged to ‘bring their own unique and diverse self’ to the class in many different ways. For instance, when freely choosing their assignment projects, diversity and uniqueness is positively incentivised in the grading criteria. 
1.6. Methods of Delivery 
Lectures will run from university week 1 to 11 with a break for the reading week (9 lectures). Seminars will run from week 2 to 11 (9 seminars).   In week 3, the seminar will take place in a computer lab. Group presentations take place in week 12. 
Lecture sessions will be used to jointly engage with the materials available for each session on Blackboard, in an active manner. Every session starts with a brief entry quiz based on the previously covered materials and assigned readings, then features an introduction and discussion of new entrepreneuring topics, and closes with a real world case discussion. 
Lecture  Seminar Hours 
Lectures: 9 x 2-hour per week in Semester 1, 15.00-17.00 on Tuesday 
Seminars: 9 x 1.5-hour on either Thursday or Friday. 
Presentations: 4 hours - 2 x 2hr 
Total contact hours:    35.5 hours 
Private study:    164.5 hours 
Total study hours: 200 hours 
1.7. Attendance 
Active access and attendance of lectures and seminars is a compulsory requirement for this course and will be monitored through Blackboard’s activity tracking function. Any student who a) misses, b) is found to be unresponsive, or c) does not participate in group work of more than two seminar session, does not fulfil the attendance requirements. 
If you are unable to attend a seminar, make sure to inform. your seminar leader of the reasons in advance. They are in charge of taking attendance and have to pass on attendance lists to the program administrators. You have to attend seminars in the slot you originally signed up for, as this is where your student group’s teamwork takes place. 
1.8. Syllabus 
The course provides you with a step-by-step guide to starting and running your own venture by answering the questions many fresh entrepreneurs face, including but not limited to: ·   What societal and environmental impact can a venture achieve?·   How do you develop ideas and start a venture?·   How can you define and reach your target market?·   Where to find funding for entrepreneurial ventures?·   What strategies can help your business grow in the long term?·   How to mitigate risks and avoid potential pitfalls threatening young companies?During this course, you will collect data on an industry of your choice using databases such as Factiva, Mintel Oxygen and Statista (available in the UoM library). You will then interpret this empirical material using theory on entrepreneurship individually and in groups.2. Teaching Schedule 3. Reading List Core Text: Burns, P. 2021. Entrepreneurship and Small Business: Start-up, Growth and Maturity. Red Globe Press, fifth edition. ISBN: 978-1352012491. Available at: Kortext.Supplementary Texts:You will be provided with additional suggested readings each week. You are strongly encouraged to read them when working on your assignments. You are also encouraged to identify and read additional readings of relevant publications, and to cite these as part of the final summative assignment.4. Assessment 
There will be two assessed assignments in this course unit. Both assignments require you to demonstrate a deep understanding of the process of establishing and growing a venture by using the concepts covered in the course to analyse empirical material (both qualitative and quantitative). The assignments are:1. Group presentation (40% of the final mark, max 10 minutes): In a group of five students come up with a B2B venture idea and pitch it in a form. of presentation, answering all 6 assessment questions.
2. Individual coursework (60% of the final mark, max 2000 words): Individually, come up with a B2C venture idea and pitch it in a form. of a report, answering all 6 assessment questions.

TOTAL 2000 7 
4.2. Word count  
There is no formal requirement for the number of slides in your group presentation. However, it is recommended you have no more than one slide per question, with the exception of question 5 that can have two slides.
For the individual report, the word count includes your main text and Risk Register table. Do not contribute to word count: 
·   Title page
·   Contents page (if you have one)
·   The text of questions
·   Appendices (if you have them)
·   All figures and tables except the Risk Register (but avoid putting large 代 写BMAN32261 Entrepreneurship and Venturing Semester 1 2024-2025
代做程序编程语言paragraphs of text into figures and tables, as it will lose you marks for poorly designed visuals)
·   References section (in-text citations still count)
+/- 10% rule applies to individual report section by section. That is, each section can have +/- 10%, but you cannot have one section twice with its word count while the other is below limit, they will not balance each other out.
4.3. Choice of topic 
Group assignment must be a B2B venture, individual assignment – a B2C venture. Within those remits, you are allowed to pick any industry, geographical region, organisational form. and technology for your venture idea. You are expected to come up with a new venture idea, thus any description of an existing company is not allowed.
To avoid duplication and potential pressure for groups presenting ideas for similar ventures, each group is required to pick a unique industry. The list of industries is available on Blackboard. The choices are allocated on the first-come-first-served basis after the groups are formed in Seminar 2. If your choice has already been picked, you will be notified and have until the next seminar to change your topic. Going further, you are encouraged to stick with the topic you have chosen, as you will lose progress and valuable feedback from previous seminars.
No such restrictions apply to individual assignment. However, if two works are too similar (down to venture details), they will be checked for collusion according to the University policy.
4.4. Introduction and conclusion 
Neither assignment requires introduction or conclusion, and you are advised against writing them. If you do – they will contribute to your word count.
4.5. Assignment Formatting 
a) General formatting 
Individual report is required to be submitted in pdf exported from Canva software. Group presentation can be in any visual format (PowerPoint, Canva, etc.). Videos can be used as a part of presentation, but cannot replace the presentation completely.
Minimum font size for both assignments is 12pt, 1.5 line spacing (except for tables where single spacing is allowed) on A4 format. Any font is acceptable. Please prioritise readability.
b) Questions 
Each section should start with the question itself, followed by the word count. The answer starts from a new paragraph. The text of the question does not contribute to the word count of the answer.  
Example: 1. What makes you a good fit to address this opportunity? (206/200) 
c) Visuals 
All visuals (tables, figures) must be numbered and labeled, with source provided (if it is your own illustration, Source: own elaboration is the common way of citation). All frameworks must be created in the software (no screenshots or phone photos of frameworks). Screenshots of images and other illustrative materials are allowed.

Example for a figure: Figure 1. AI in agricultureSource: Reuters, 2024d) Frameworks 
The minimum requirements for each question are discussed in the respective lecture. Both assignments focus on applying theory to practice. You can assume a specialised audience and only give a very brief explanation of the concept. Thus, you are expected to use formal frameworks to present your case and critically assess the industry data you have collected as well as reflect on the framework's necessity. However, you are not expected to provide critical comparison and elaboration on the theory per se.  
Example of a correct approach: I used Ansoff's matrix (Ansoff, 1957) to determine the order 
of the venture expansion. This tool highlighted that while diversifying after market penetration is commercially attractive, there is a risk of being stuck in the middle. Having assessed this risk (please see Risk Register) as unacceptably high, I will prioritise market development first.
Example of excessive description: Ansoff's matrix is an analytical tool that allows plotting the company's development across different products and markets (Burns, 2021). It was developed by Ansoff in 1957. While some scholars criticise it for excessive simplification of venture growth (Jarratt  Stiles, 2010), it remains the best tool to understand the issue of diversification.
e) Data sources 
Primary data collection, such as interviews or surveys, is not allowed in this course due to ethical considerations.
You can collect data available online. To facilitate this process, three databases are suggested for the course:1) Factiva – newspaper database that can be helpful finding qualitative information about your potential market. 2) Mintel Oxygen – industry reports and trend insights. 3) Statista – statistical data on industries, useful to find quantitative data for market forecasts. 
While using all three databases is not a requirement, we would expect to see information found with the help of the databases and other reliable sources presented in your report. Informal sources, such as blogs and social networks, are acceptable, but require triangulation as they are less reliable. Please consult the grading rubric for a more in-depth explanation.
f) Foreign language sources 
You can use sources in languages other than English. However, when quoting them in text you must provide an English translation. The name of the author can be kept in its original language or transliterated into roman script. (not translated). The details of including non-English sources in the list of references are available in the Harvard Manchester referencing style. Please keep in mind that using AI translation tools such as Google Translate without editing it is considered as the use of AI and has to be reported.  
Example: 
Spain is a good starting market for this digital start-up due to my (the founder's) existing network and the recent government policy aiming to "promote entrepreneurship, 
self-employment and the new job opportunities offered by the digital economy" (Ministerio de Trabajo y Economía Social, 2021, p.12).
If you are using a rare foreign-language term that the reader might be unfamiliar with, you should not translate it. Instead, use English transliteration, italicise the term and make a footnote with the source language, original spelling and explanation of the term.  
Example: 
To maintain entrepreneurial culture, we will use the RenDanHeYi1 approach.
___________________________________
1 RenDanHeYi (Simplified Chinese: 人单合一) – an intrapreneurial value-centered and customer-facing approach pioneered by Haier that suggests creating independent internal teams 
to create additional user value through interaction with customers (Haier, 2024).
g) References 
References must adhere to Harvard Manchester referencing style. In group presentation, references should be put on a separate slide.
Referencing lecture slides is not allowed in the assignments. Please find the original source of citations – either through Burns's textbook or additional readings.
h) Appendices 
Some visual information, such as photos of websites or industry statistics, can be put in the appendices to assist understanding. However, no part of your answer should be put there. For instance, the Risk Register cannot be put into appendix.
